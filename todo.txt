        notifications
        use Deps.autorun(function(){//find or session)}) on settings collection/title/etc

DON'T NEED TO LAUNCH
allow non-logged in users to hate on it
limit post/comment time reasonably
prevent dupe hating
unsure unique usernames
posts could check if comments exist so as to not depend
error check comments (insert/update & values)
pathFor links for user names & most popular words
bring all the code into continuity
require user intervention before inserting new posts (twitter style?)
search
try also the way i previously did it but resetting the cursor!
try associating data in the data context area in router!





single post page is broken
